# JuaCode AI Assistant

JuaCode AI is a modern AI chat application with a FastAPI‑powered backend and a React‑based frontend that uses Deepseek‑r1, OpenAI's o3‑mini, and Gemini 2.0‑flash APIs.

- **Backend:**  
  Built with FastAPI, it handles chat generation, user management, and database interactions. For detailed logic, check out the code in the `backend/` folder.

- **Frontend:**  
  A sleek, responsive React interface that manages chat interactions and error handling. Browse the `frontend/` folder to see the components and UI design.

Here's JuaCode AI in action (users can choose between `regular` and `reasoning` models when using Deepseek-r1 or o3-mini):
